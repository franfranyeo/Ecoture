#### README
### Steps to move from your own branch into main using Github Desktop
1. Fetch and pull origin
2. Make sure to merge main into your current branch first and fix conflicts (if any).
3. Once merged successfully, push to your own branch.
4. Create a pull request using (https://github.com/franfranyeo/Ecoture/compare) and set base: main and compare: <your-branch>
5. Create the PR and view the affected files in the 'Files changed' tab to see the changes you made to the code.
6. Once everything is checked, merge the PR into main branch.

### NOTE
Please update your branch frequently and keep it in sync with the main branch from time to time, so you won't have to deal with a huge mess when you try to merge your code (day 1 + your changes) into the latest main (day 5000 + everyone's changes). It will practically be impossible to do so because of how big the difference will be.

Thank you - :D
